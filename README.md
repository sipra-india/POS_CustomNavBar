# Custom Bottom Navigation Bar 

This project demonstrates a **custom animated bottom navigation bar** built entirely in **React Native using Expo Snack**.

### Features

- Fully animated circle background that moves with tab change
- Smooth transitions using `Animated` API (no Reanimated or SVGs)
- Curved navbar effect built entirely with `View` components
- Icons implemented using simple emoji-based `<Text>` (🏠, 📍)
- Works out-of-the-box on Snack without any external libraries

### Design Highlights

- The "curve" behind the icons is achieved **without SVGs** or special libraries.
- Only `View` components with smart border radius and positioning are used to create a **semicircle-like background movement**.
- The active icon **lifts up slightly** when selected using smooth `translateY` animation.

### 🛠Technologies Used

- **React Native **
- **Animated API** (`react-native` built-in, no `react-native-reanimated`)
- **Emoji-based icons** (no vector icons or images)
